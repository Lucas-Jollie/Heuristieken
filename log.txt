randomGenome.py made

Used for testing alternative genomes.s

intelSort1.py was also made
wrongfull counting caused to solve genomes in 23 steps, always

intelSort2.py as a better alterative
Amount of steps to solve vary, original genome from heuristieken.nl
done in 18 steps
Random generated genome between 17 and 22 steps
